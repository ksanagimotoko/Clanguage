File Mode   Operation
r           opens an existing file for reading
w           opens an existing file for writing - creates a new file if none exists and discards all its previous contents.
a           appends-opens or creates a text file for writing at the end of the file.

r+          read/update
            Open a file for update(both for input and output). The file must exit.
            
w+          write/update
            Create an empty file and open it for update(both for input and output).
            If a file with the same name already exists its contents are discarded and the file is treated as a new empty file.
            
a+          append/update
            Open a file for update (both for input and output) with all output operations writing data at the end of the file. 
            Repositioning operations(fseek, fsetpos,, rewind) affects the next input operations,
            but output operations move the possition back to the end of file. 
            The file is created if it does not exist.
